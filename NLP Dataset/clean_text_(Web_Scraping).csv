While demand for commercial aircraft is strong, the company is facing significant engine shortages due to issues with its supplier Pratt & Whitney, said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury.

Economic output and the stock market are surging, consumers are spending big and the post-pandemic recession that many expected never materialized. But many feel terrible about their finances, with debt at all-time highs, and the majority of Americans incorrectly believe the country is in an economic slowdown.

But, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, India, he also said: ""I do think we always have to think about, maybe even worry a little bit about Chinese subsidies."" Chinese AI companies have been supported by their government with measures such as a multi-billion-dollar national investment fund and vouchers for cheaper energy for their computing needs. Smith's warning comes after Chinese firms released a slew of models over the past two weeks, and their lower-cost AI models could be attractive in developing nations"
"Berkshire Hathaway trims Apple stake, buys NYTimes stock in Buffett's last moves as CEO. In this article Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway trimmed more of its Apple stake and began a new position in The New York Times in the fourth quarter, according to a new securities filing. The Omaha-based conglomerate disclosed that it pared its position in the iPhone maker by 4.3% to 61.96 billion, per data from InsiderScore. Even with the cut, Apple remains by far Berkshire's largest equity holding. Berkshire revealed that it trimmed its stake in Apple and started a stake in fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" name Alphabet in the third quarter. The conglomerate had also cut its equity holding of Apple in the second quarter of last year after slashing its stake by two-thirds in 2024. While Apple posted its third consecutive winning year in 2025, rising around 9%, it still underperformed the S&P 500, which gained more than 16% last year. The stock has been lagging even more this year, falling about 3%. In fact, it experienced its worst day since April 2025 just last week. It's unclear whe"
"CFTC defends its right to prediction market enforcement as states challenge platforms. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed an amicus brief in federal court on Tuesday to assert the agency's right to enforce prediction markets instead of individual states, according to its new chairman, Michael Selig. Selig argued in a Monday Wall Street Journal op-ed that the CFTC has always had authority over prediction markets and determining whether the event contracts constitute gambling, as critics allege. Selig noted nearly 50 active legal cases against prediction markets and said the CFTC would be stepping in to prevent state encroachment. ""The CFTC will no longer sit idly by while overzealous state governments undermine the agency's exclusive jurisdiction over these markets by seeking to establish statewide prohibitions on these exciting products,"" he wrote. The move comes as prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket face legal challenges in multiple states over event contracts. The platforms allow users to bet on the outcomes of events in pop culture, sports, ent"
"In bitcoin price plummet, ETF flows are down but aren't signaling 'crypto winter' investor panic. In this article Bitcoin's massive slump from a record price above 126,000 last October has darkened sentiment across the crypto landscape. Faith has been shaken in a trade that was viewed as a digital rival to gold as a store of value, and by some others as a risk-on asset that would continue to boom alongside a crypto-friendly Trump administration. Since the all-time high price last October, bitcoin has lost almost half its value and its inability to bounce back in trading is increasing fears about another ""crypto winter"" a prolonged slump similar to the time of the FTX crash in 2022 when bitcoin fell from near 50,000 to as low as 15,000. In the past month alone, bitcoin is down over 25%. But crypto investing experts on the latest CNBC ""ETF Edge"" say a look at the recent flows into and out of bitcoin and crypto exchange-trade funds suggests that long-term investors are not abandoning the asset class. Money has certainly moved out, but they say not to a level that suggests long-t"
"AI disruption could spark a shock to the system in credit markets, UBS analyst says. The stock market has been quick to punish software firms and other perceived losers from the artificial intelligence boom in recent weeks, but credit markets are likely to be the next place where AI disruption risk shows up, according to UBS analyst Matthew Mish . Tens of billions of dollars in corporate loans are likely to default over the next year as companies, especially software and data services firms owned by private equity, get squeezed by the AI threat, Mish said in a Wednesday research note. ""We're pricing in part of what we call a rapid, aggressive disruption scenario,"" Mish, UBS head of credit strategy, told CNBC in an interview. The UBS analyst said he and his colleagues have rushed to update their forecasts for this year and beyond because the latest models from Anthropic and OpenAI have sped up expectations of the arrival of AI disruption. ""The market has been slow to react because they didn't really think it was going to happen this fast,"" Mish said. ""People are having"
"China's Baidu adds OpenClaw AI into search app for 700 million users ahead of Lunar New Year. In this article BEIJING Baidu plans to give users of its main smartphone app direct access to the wildly popular artificial intelligence tool OpenClaw, according to a spokesperson for the Chinese tech company. Starting later on Friday, users who opt in can message the AI agent through Baidu's main search app to complete tasks such as scheduling, organizing files and writing code. AI agents such as OpenClaw have surged in popularity recently for their ability to automate tasks, including managing email and using online services. Previously, the Austrian-developed open-sourced AI agent could only be accessed from chat apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram. Chinese companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have already allowed users to run OpenClaw on their cloud systems. Baidu claims 700 million monthly active users for its search app. The company is also rolling out OpenClaw's capabilities to its e-commerce business and other services. The rollout comes just days ahead of China's Luna"
"Xiaomi's electric SUV tops China sales in January, sells twice as many as Tesla's Model Y. BEIJING Xiaomi 's electric car venture has succeeded in dethroning Tesla in China, at least in January. The Xiaomi YU7 SUV ranked first in China by sales last month, with 37,869 units sold, twice as many as Tesla's 16,845 Model Y vehicles, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. The Model Y, which was the best-selling model in December, plunged to 20th place in January. Among new energy vehicles, it also fell from the first position to seventh over the same period. The figures include both electric and gasoline-powered vehicles and were published late Thursday by online car sales platform Autohome. Xiaomi started selling the YU7 , its second electric car model, roughly half a year ago in the summer of 2025. The Chinese company, best known for its smartphones, hasn't been shy about its aim to take on Tesla. Xiaomi launched the car at a starting price that was 10,000 yuan 1,450 below the Model Y in China. The company claimed the model beat Tesla on key metrics s"
"Tech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of 1 trillion in debt sales. While the prospect of a SpaceX initial public offering and the hopeful listings from OpenAI and Anthropic have juiced IPO excitement on Wall Street, the current action in tech capital markets has nothing to do with equity. Rather, it's all about debt. Tech's four hyperscalers Alphabet , Amazon , Meta and Microsoft are collectively projected to shell out close to 700 billion this year on capital expenditures and finance leases to fuel their artificial intelligence buildouts, responding to what they call historic levels of demand for computing resources. To finance those investments, industry giants may have to dip into some of the cash they've built up in recent years. But they're also looking to raise mounds of debt, adding to concerns about an AI bubble and fears about a market contagion if cash-burning startups like OpenAI and Anthropic hit a growth wall and pull back on their infrastructure spending. In a report late last month, UBS estimated that after tech and AI-related deb"
"David Einhorn says the Fed will cut 'substantially more' than two times. So he's betting big on gold. In this article Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn anticipates the Federal Reserve will issue more interest rate cuts this year than what's being anticipated and that's giving him greater confidence in his gold bet. While rate cut expectations diminished a bit Wednesday following the much better-than-expected January jobs report , traders are still currently pricing in a more than 88% chance that the central bank will make two quarter percentage point cuts by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool . But Einhorn said that the market viewing the latest jobs figures as a reason not to cut is ""wrong."" In fact, he thinks the rate cuts number could be higher than that, as he expects Kevin Warsh President Donald Trump's pick to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair is going to be able to persuade the committee to do so. ""If we have 4% or 5% inflation, sure, then he won't be able to persuade people, but otherwise he's going to argue productivity,"" Einhorn said on CNBC's "" Mo"
"Crypto's 'age of speculation' may be over, says Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz. Throughout its history, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been subject to significant price fluctuations, whether that's due to larger macro factors impacting all asset classes or during ""crypto winters"" tied to industry concerns. But with a crypto-friendly Trump administration and expectations for passage of a cryptocurrency market structure bill , many onlookers expected another bull run in digital assets to start 2026. However, it's been the exact opposite . Bitcoin is down more than 21% so far this year, and it fell to 60,062.00 last week its lowest level in roughly 16 months. That marked a drop of nearly 50% from its record back in October 2025. What is driving this latest decline? Rather than a single event, Galaxy founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said at the CNBC Digital Finance Forum on Tuesday in New York City that it's a reflection of a larger industry shift. When bitcoin fell 22% in less than a day back in November 2022 following the collapse of FTX , there was a ""br"

"Bitcoin plunge: Bitwise CIO cites 'the four-year cycle' as No. 1 reason for losses. A multibillion-dollar crypto asset manager cites several reasons for the bitcoin plunge, but he's listing ""the four-year cycle"" as the No. 1 downward catalyst. According to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, it's a phenomenon that's happened three other times in the crypto market. ""People are looking for one thing to blame for the current retracement in bitcoin . But there is not any one thing to blame,"" he told "" ETF Edge "" on Monday. Hougan contends investors have been favoring other hot investments including gold and artificial intelligence stocks over cryptocurrencies, too. ""There is some quantum risk . There is fear of Fed nominee Kevin Warsh,"" he said. ""In bear markets, all these things are amplified."" When he was on ""ETF Edge"" last November , bitcoin had fallen below the 90,000 mark for the first time since April. Its record high of 126,279 was hit in October.

The company is close to finalizing a global bond issuance in excess of 30 billion, according to two people familiar with the deal, an increase from the 20 billion it raised on Monday. On Tuesday morning, Alphabet went to the European market to raise roughly 11 billion in sterling and Swiss francs, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details are private. Bloomberg reported earlier that Alphabet raised almost 32 billion. Investors are showing heightened demand for high-quality paper from tech heavyweights that are leading the charge in artificial intelligence, one source said. In its earnings report last week, Alphabet said it expects to shell out up to 185 billion in capital expenditures this year, more than double its 2025 capex.

"Michael Saylor downplays Strategy credit risk as bitcoin tumbles: 'We'll refinance the debt'. Strategy CEO Michael Saylor brushed off concerns about the company's credit risk if bitcoin continues to tumble. In fact, Saylor said he plans to keep accumulating the cryptocurrency for the company every quarter. ""If bitcoin falls 90% for the next four years, we'll refinance the debt,"" the executive said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box. "" ""We'll just roll it forward."" Asked whether he believed banks would continue to lend to the digital asset treasury firm if bitcoin collapses, Saylor said, ""Yeah, because the volatility of bitcoin is such that it's always going to be a value.""

"Alphabet calls out new AI-related risks, as it taps debt market to fund build-out. In this article As Alphabet returns to the debt market to fund its artificial intelligence build-out, the company is acknowledging new risks tied to the rise of AI and its hefty investments in infrastructure. In its annual financial report late last week, the Google parent highlighted the potential impact of AI on the company's core advertising business and the possibility of ending up with ""excess capacity"" from its costly commitments. ""To meet the compute capacity demands of AI training and inference, as well as traditional cloud computing services, we are entering into significant leasing arrangements with third party operators, which may increase costs and operational complexity,"" the company stated in the filing with the SEC.

"S&P is already predicting China's property slump will be worse than it expected this year. BEIJING S&P Global Ratings has lowered its forecast for China property sales this year, barely two months into 2026. The firm said Sunday that primary real estate sales will likely drop by 10% to 14% this year, worse than the 5% to 8% decline for 2026 sales predicted back in October. ""This is a downturn so entrenched that only the government has capacity to absorb the excess inventory,"" the analysts said in a note. They added that the state could buy more unsold property to create affordable housing, but that so far these efforts have been piecemeal. China's property market, once accounting for more than a quarter of the economy, has seen its annual sales volume halve in just four years. Beijing's crackdown on developers' high reliance on debt for growth sparked the initial slump, while consumer demand for homes has yet to pick up. Economists have long warned of overbuilding in China's property market. But developers have only kept up construction despite the sales slump, leading to"

"China's Luckin Coffee opens first high-end store as it takes on Starbucks. BEIJING China's Luckin Coffee is taking direct aim at Starbucks ' high-end roastery chain with a new flagship store in the country's south that sells premium drinks. It's Luckin's first major departure from its original strategy of operating budget-priced coffee kiosks a move that helped the company overtake Starbucks in terms of the number of storefronts in China. Now, with the U.S. company selling off most of its struggling China business to a local investment firm, Luckin is proving it's more than made a comeback from fraud allegations in 2020 that forced it to delist from the Nasdaq. The Chinese company on Sunday officially opened its two-floor Luckin Coffee Origin Flagship in Shenzhen on the border with Hong Kong. In contrast to Luckin's typical offerings priced at roughly 1 or 2 for an Americano or latte, the flagship store has nudged prices slightly higher for a range of pour-over and cold brew coffee drinks.

Amid recent debate over the so-called ""Sell America"" trade and capital rotating out of U.S. markets, foreign stocks have received most of the attention . But international bonds, especially emerging market bonds, have also been riding high.

Bitcoin traded at about 74,500 at its bottom on Monday its lowest price since last April.

"SoftBank books 4.2 billion gain on OpenAI bet, boosting its Vision Fund.

"Lyft stock falls 15% on disappointing fourth-quarter results, rider numbers. In this article Lyft 's stock tumbled 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the ride-sharing company posted disappointing fourth-quarter results. Here's how the company did versus LSEG estimates: The comparable revenue figure excludes reserve changes and settlements, and a special item analysts hadn't accounted for in projections.

"Hassett says authors of New York Fed tariff study should be disciplined: 'Worst paper I've ever seen'. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Wednesday that the authors of a recent New York Federal Reserve paper that found U.S. companies and consumers are shouldering most of the tariff burden should be ""disciplined."" In a CNBC interview, the National Economic Council director ripped the report, saying that central bank researchers ignored key aspects of how the duties worked and instead simply focused on prices. Hassett said the research also should have included the upward impact on wages and benefits that U.S. companies see by bringing more production onshore. ""I mean, the paper is an embarrassment,"" Hassett said during the ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-"
"UK inflation cools markedly in January, boosting odds of Bank of England rate cut. In this article The U.K. inflation rate cooled to 3% in January, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics ONS . Economists polled by Reuters had expected the consumer price index to fall to 3%, down from 3.4% in the twelve months to December. Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, stood at 3.1% in January, down from 3.2% in December . The fall in Inflation, to its lowest annual rate since March 2025, was driven partly by a decrease in petrol prices, the ONS' Chief Economist Grant Fitzner said in comments on X. ""Airfares were another downward driver this month with prices dropping back following the increase in December. Lower food prices also helped push the rate down, particularly for bread and cereals and meat. These were partially offset by the cost of hotel stays and takeaways,"" he noted. Sterling was flat against the dollar following the as-expected data, at 1.3562. The data will be closely analysed by the Bank of England as"
"Consumer prices rose 2.4% annually in January, less than expected. The cost of goods and services rose at a slower annual rate than expected in January, providing hope that the nagging U.S. inflation problem could be starting to ease. The consumer price index for January accelerated 2.4% from the same time a year ago, down 0.3 percentage point from the prior month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. That pulled the inflation rate down to where it was the month after President Donald Trump in April 2025 announced aggressive tariffs on U.S. imports. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI was up 2.5%, the lowest level since April 2021. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an annual rate of 2.5% for both readings. On a monthly basis, the all-items index was up a seasonally adjusted 0.2% while core gained 0.3%. The forecast had been 0.3% for both. Though the category accounted for much of the CPI gain, shelter costs rose just 0.2% for the month, bringing the annual increase down to 3%. Shelter makes up more than one-third of"
"The January CPI inflation report is due out Friday morning. Here's what it's expected to show. Investors got some good news this week on the state of the labor market, and more may be on the way Friday on inflation. The consumer price index, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, is expected to show a 2.5% gain from a year ago, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast for the January release. If that ends up being accurate, it would bring the widely cited inflation gauge back to its May 2025 level a month after President Donald Trump enacted his ""liberation day"" tariffs , which many economists thought would send prices spiraling higher. The headline, or all-items, CPI was at 2.7% in December and has been on a downward trajectory since peaking just above 3% in September. Excluding food and energy, core CPI stood at 2.6% in December. Both gauges are expected to show 0.3% monthly increases in January. It's also worth noting that CPI has come in below the Wall Street consensus for the past three months. So, a light reading for January could give"
"UK economy ekes out 0.1% growth in the fourth quarter. The U.K. economy grew a meager 0.1% in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary figures from the Office for National Statistics on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters expected the economy to have grown 0.2% over the October-December period, following 0.1% growth in the third quarter . Month-on-month, the economy expanded 0.1% in December, down from a 0.2% expansion, revised down from 0.3%, the previous month. Pound sterling was flat against the dollar following the data, at 1.3624. The ONS' Director of Economic Statistics Liz McKeown said the latest data showed a mixed economic picture. ""The often-dominant services sector showed no growth, with the main driver instead coming from manufacturing. Construction, meanwhile, registered its worst performance in more than four years,"" she said on X Thursday. The U.K. economy is estimated to have grown 1.3% in 2025, the ONS noted, following growth of 1.1% in 2024. The growth figures come after the Bank of England voted narrowly at its"
"The jobs picture still looks muddy, even with surprisingly strong January growth. January job gains were better than anything the U.S. economy saw in 2025 but not still enough to sound an all-clear on what has otherwise been a stagnant labor market. With a gain of 130,000 nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate slipping to 4.3%, the lowest since August, the numbers indicated that hiring is at least hanging in there while layoffs appear contained. However, beneath the hood there were some trouble spots: A continued concentration in just a few fields where hiring is happening; revisions that meant virtually no gains in the second half of 2025, and questions over what happens from here as companies contend with a high level of uncertainty. ""I would anticipate that for the rest of the year, job growth is going to be quite subdued,"" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. ""Whether it's as subdued as 2025 ... is still an open question. But I would not expect job growth to be higher than 50,000 for the remainder of 2026."" Indeed, revisions the Bureau of Lab"
"Tariff revenue soars more than 300% as U.S. awaits Supreme Court decision. The U.S. government in January ran up a smaller deficit than a year ago, while tariff collections surged and provided a reminder of how pivotal a long-awaited Supreme Court decision could be to federal fiscal health. Customs duties collected through tariffs totaled 30 billion for the month, putting the fiscal year-to-date tally at 124 billion, or 304% more than the same period in 2025. President Donald Trump first levied the duties in April 2025 with an across-the-board rate on all goods and services entering the U.S. along with a menu of so-called reciprocal tariffs on individual countries. Since then, the White House has been negotiating with its trading partners, backing off on some of the more aggressive charges while maintaining tough talk on issues. Last November, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments challenging the auspices under which Trump justified the tariffs. The decision was expected in January. The high court hasn't ruled yet, and there's concern in the White House t"
"Here are the five key takeaways from the January jobs report. The January nonfarm payrolls report beat Wall Street expectations in both job creation and the unemployment rate. Here are the top five takeaways: ""Just in: GREAT JOBS NUMBERS, FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED! The United States of America should be paying MUCH LESS on its Borrowings BONDS! . We are again the strongest Country in the World, and should therefore be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far. This would be an INTEREST COST SAVINGS OF AT LEAST ONE TRILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR - BALANCED BUDGET, PLUS. WOW! The Golden Age of America is upon us!!!"" President Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post ""The strong payrolls print in January may be somewhat exaggerated: construction payrolls jumped, sensitive to warmer January weather; healthcare payrolls were well above trend; and retail stabilized. The underlying pace for private payrolls is probably closer to 50k per month after accounting for the temporary strength in those areas, close to the recent pace."" Michael Gapen, Morgan Stanley"
"U.S. payrolls rose by 130,000 in January, more than expected; unemployment down to 4.3%. Job growth was stronger than expected to start 2026, providing some relief to concerns about the state of the U.S. labor market. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 for January, above the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 55,000, according to seasonally adjusted figures the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday. The total also was an improvement over December, which saw a gain of 48,000 after a slight downward revision. The unemployment rate edged lower to 4.3%, below the forecast to stay unchanged at 4.4% from the prior month. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons slipped to 8%, down 0.4 percentage point from December. Markets rose following the news, with stock market futures ticking higher. Treasury yields also posted strong gains. The report, delayed nearly a week by the partial government shutdown that ended Feb. 3, held consistent with a labor market in a low-growth mode, though with only"
"The delayed January jobs report will be released Wednesday. Here's what to expect. The jobs report Wednesday will give markets a lot to consider, as investors parse through fresh data and a batch of revisions. Economists expect that January's nonfarm payrolls report will show growth that was nil or not much better during the month. On top of that, annual revisions also could reveal that the U.S. economy going back to early 2024 had generated few if any net jobs, casting further doubt on the health of the labor market. ""I think zero would be the forecast,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""The consensus is probably around 50,000. Anything around zero just shows you how fragile things are, just very weak. This is all happening with no layoffs, but layoffs are going to pick up. I think we could get job losses here pretty soon."" The payrolls report will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. It was delayed five days due to the brief government shutdown. Officially, the Dow Jones consensus forecast is calling for payroll gains of 55,000, a number that has bee"
"Disappointing holiday season: December retail sales were flat, falling well short of estimate. Consumer activity slowed sharply for the December holiday shopping season amid a spate of rough weather, tariff impact and persistently higher inflation, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Retail sales were flat on the month following a 0.6% increase in November, according to numbers adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected an increase of 0.4%. Excluding autos, sales also were unchanged, against the estimate for a 0.3% increase. On an annual basis, sales rose 2.4%, a considerable step down from the 3.3% pace in November. Sales ex-autos were up 3.3% annually in December. A measure known as the ""control group"" of sales that excludes a number of items and feeds directly into gross domestic product calculations showed a 0.1% drop for the month. The report puts a downbeat end to an otherwise solid year for shopping activity, with higher-end consumers spending briskly through much of 2025, though those on the lower end of the income sp"

U.S. employers announced 108,435 layoffs for the month, up 118% from the same period a year ago and 205% from December 2025. The total marked the highest for any January since 2009, while the economy was in the final months of its steepest downturn since the Great Depression. At the same time, companies announced just 5,306 new hires, also the lowest January since 2009, which is when Challenger began tracking such data. The crisis recession officially ended in March 2009. With the recent narrative centering on a no-hire, no-fire labor market, the Challenger data suggests that the layoff part of the equation could be stepping up. ""Generally, we see a high number of job cuts in the first quarter, but this is a high total for January,"" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and"
"China's Xi reasserts Taiwan stance in call with Trump, while U.S. president pushes trade. U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he had a ""long and thorough call"" with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, naming Iran, Russia's war in Ukraine, China's energy purchases and his upcoming visit in April among the key talking points. Beijing's statement, however, singled out Taiwan as ""the most important issue"" in bilateral relations, urging the U.S. to ""handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence."" China maintains Taiwan is part of its territory, claims that have been rejected by the democratically governed island. Washington approved arms sales to Taiwan worth as much as 11.15 billion in December last year one of its biggest ever to strengthen the island's defenses and deter any military aggression by Beijing. China appears to be reminding Washington ""where the red lines are"" while seeking to avoid any action that could jeopardize Trump's plans to visit China in April, said David Meale, practice head for China at Eurasia Group. Trump during his call str"
"January jobs report will be released on Feb. 11 after shutdown delay. The January jobs report delayed by the brief government shutdown will be released next week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday. The closely watched report now will come out Feb. 11, five days later than its original release date, according to a revised schedule . In addition, the BLS will release the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey on Thursday, after it originally had been scheduled for Tuesday. There are other delays as well. The consumer price index for January now will be released on Feb. 13, two days later than its original release date. A companion release, which computes real earnings, will be subject to the same delay. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the nonfarm payrolls report to show a gain of 60,000 jobs for the month, following an increase of 50,000 in December. The report also is projected to show that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.4%. Earlier Wednesday, payrolls processing firm ADP reported that companies added just 22,000 jobs in Janua"
"Private payrolls rose by just 22,000 in January, far short of expectations, ADP says. The U.S. labor market barely budged in January, with hiring below even muted expectations, according to a report Wednesday from payrolls processing firm ADP. Private companies added just 22,000 positions for the month and the number would have been negative had it not been for a surge of 74,000 hires in the education and health services category. The total was less than the downwardly revised 37,000 increase in December and below the Dow Jones consensus forecast for 45,000. The report starts 2026 off on basically the same note where 2025 ended: A lackluster job market in a low-hire, low-fire environment that likely will do little to quell fears from Federal Reserve policymakers that more support may be needed. ""Hiring is softening. It continues a pattern that we've noticed for the past three years,"" Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, said on CNBC. ""Employers are very reticent to hire in the current economy."" Richardson noted that benchmark revisions the firm employed to its data"
"Trump refuses to be outdone by Europe, signing his own U.S.-India trade deal. U.S. President Donald Trump 's announcement Monday that he has agreed a trade deal with India comes hot on the heels of Europe's own trade agreement with New Delhi, signaling Washington is not willing to be outdone by its global competitors. The U.S. deal comes after global trading partners like the European Union and India, and China and Canada, have signed their own trade pacts since the new year, leaving America which has been trigger-happy when it comes to imposing punitive tariffs on trading partners looking ostracized . Analysts had said those deals, and particularly the EU-India pact, could ""light a fire"" under the U.S. to get its own stalled trade agreement with India done and dusted, but it has come quicker than most expected. Trump announced Monday on the Truth Social media platform that the U.S. would cut the main tariff on India from 25% to 18%. He said Washington would also remove an additional 25% tariff it had imposed on New Delhi last summer in retaliation for its"
"Friday's jobs report will be delayed because of the partial government shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will not be releasing the January jobs report as scheduled Friday due to the partial government shutdown, a department spokesman confirmed Monday. ""The Employment Situation release for January 2026 will not be released as scheduled on Friday, February 6, 2026. The release will be rescheduled upon the resumption of government funding,"" Emily Liddel, associate commissioner of the BLS, said in a statement. Following last year's record shutdown that stretched into early November, the bureau also was forced to delay a number of its routine releases and was just catching up from that incident. The BLS also releases the consumer price index, import and export data, and multiple other labor- and consumer-related data pieces. It was not known if the Commerce Department also would face delays in its reporting due to the impasse in Washington. The decision comes ahead of a busy week for economic data that would have culminated with the nonfarm payrolls release, als"
"From PopMart to JD.com: Britain and China rush to forge business deals as diplomatic thaw takes hold. In this article Chinese businesses have pledged hundreds of millions of pounds' worth of investment in the U.K. and struck new partnerships with British peers as Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China spurred a flurry of bilateral business activity and investment flows. During his four-day visit in China last week, Starmer met Chinese President Xi Jinping and secured deals that would see hundreds of millions worth of new investments from Chinese businesses, in addition to 2.2 billion 3 billion worth of exports and 2.3 billion in market access, according to a statement from the prime minister's office. Following the high-profile visit, the two leaders hailed the benefits of cooperation, with Xi describing the bilateral ties as ""mutually beneficial."" Starmer, who brought a large delegation of executives from banking, pharmaceutical, and automobile companies to China, also described the country as vital to Britain's interests. While no sweeping free trade deal was reached, com"
"China's factory activity grows at fastest pace since October, private survey shows, beating official reading. China's factory activity gathered speed in January, according to a private survey released Monday, as manufacturers accelerated production and front-loaded cargoes ahead of the extended Lunar New Year holiday. The seasonally-adjusted RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI, conducted by S&P Global, rose to 50.3 in January from 50.1 the previous month, in line with analysts' expectations of 50.3 in a Reuters poll. A reading above the 50 benchmark indicates an expansion, while one below that suggests contraction. That marked the strongest level since October, when the private-surveyed PMI came in at 50.6 . Production accelerated last month as new orders picked up both at home and abroad, prompting firms to hire additional staff to cope with rising workloads and clear outstanding orders. Total new orders expanded for the eighth straight month while new export orders rebounded, primarily buoyed by increased demand from overseas buyers, particularly Southeast Asia. Business confidence, h"
"Hassett praises Trump's pick of Warsh to lead Fed, says he has his 'dream job' already. Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director once considered a clear front-runner to be named the next Federal Reserve chair, said Friday he is fine with continuing in his current role. Fresh off President Donald Trump 's announcement that former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh will be the new chair , Hassett told CNBC that he was not disappointed and understands and supports the decision. ""I've got my dream job,"" he said in a "" Squawk on the Street "" interview. ""I think President Trump made a great choice, and I'm really thrilled and humbled by all the kind things he said about me."" In a Truth Social post , Trump said Hassett ""is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn't want to let him go. Kevin is indescribably good so, as the expression goes, 'if you can't do better, don't try to fix it!' Thank you Kevin for doing such a great job!"" Hassett made similar comments, saying that an economic team that includes himself, Treasury S"
"Wealth inequality and the 'K-shaped' economy are more striking than ever, data shows. The gap between the best and worse off Americans is growing and economists don't see an end in sight. The ""K-shaped"" economy has been top of mind for consumers, corporate leaders, policymakers and investors since the Covid pandemic drastically reshaped Americans' financial habits almost six years ago. Economists now warn that this two-speed economic structure is a core feature rather than a passing fad within the world's largest economy . ""This is not a cyclical or temporary phenomena,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""This is a structural, fundamental issue."" The prevailing theory goes something like this: Higher-earning consumers, encouraged by rallying stock holdings and elevated property values , are splashing out on vacations and premium goods. On the other hand, after years of higher-than-ideal inflation rates , lower-income cohorts are struggling to afford necessities such as housing, groceries and gasoline. Taken together, recent data suggests that"
"Scenic trains, cruises and concerts: China s new plan to get consumers spending again. As Chinese households remain reluctant to spend on big-ticket goods, Beijing is leaning on a new lever to revive consumption: experiences and everyday services. China's cabinet on Thursday rolled out a work plan to boost services consumption from cruise and yacht tourism to elder care services and more sports events as policymakers sought to boost the share of consumption in its economy over the next five years. The plan aims to ""accelerate the cultivation of new growth drivers in service consumption"" and to ""improve and expand the supply of services,"" the notice said. Beijing's renewed push came as officials try to shore up domestic demand amid a prolonged property slump, bleak job market and income uncertainty that have kept consumers cautious about major purchases. Concerns are also growing that the export boom that cushioned the economy from U.S. tariffs last year may prove difficult to sustain. While Beijing has rolled out trade-in subsidies to spur sales of cars and applianc"
"Trump to announce Fed chair nominee Friday; Kevin Warsh may be his pick, according to reports. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will be naming his pick Friday for the new Federal Reserve chair. Speaking at the premiere for ""Melania,"" the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said a process that began last summer of finding his choice to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end. ""I'll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning,"" Trump said. Asked if he had actually settled on a choice, he replied, ""I do, I better, otherwise I have to go to work very quickly."" Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh is expected to be Trump's pick, according to multiple media reports. If Warsh, 55, is Trump's nominee, it might not ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street's view that he wouldn't automatically do Trump's bidding. ""He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets,"" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't go"
"Trade deficit soared 94% in November and was higher than a year ago, despite tariff efforts. The U.S. deficit with its global trading partners nearly doubled in November as the shortfall with the European Union swelled and the impact of President Donald Trump 's tariffs worked their way through the economy, the Census Bureau reported Thursday. Following a month where the trade deficit hit its lowest level since early 2009, it shot up to 56.8 billion, an increase of 94.6% from October. Of that gain, about one-third came with the European Union, where the goods deficit rose by 8.2 billion. The goods deficit with China decreased by about 1 billion to 13.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, the deficit through November stood at 839.5 billion, or about 4% higher than the same period in 2024. The increase in the deficit counters Trump's efforts to use tariffs to reduce imbalances around the globe. When announcing so-called reciprocal tariffs in April 2025, the White House used the level of trade deficits with varying countries as a baseline for determining the duties. As the"
"China and the UK are attempting to reset their relationship here's how. After years of strained ties, China and the U.K. are looking to develop a long-term strategic partnership following a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Starmer is on a 4-day visit to China, the first trip by a British prime minister in eight years signaling an attempt at resetting relations between the two countries after years of distrust and acrimony. Beijing's crackdowns on democratic protests in Hong Kong, a former British colony, and imposition of a sweeping national security legislation in 2020 strained bilateral ties, while U.K. businesses in China have flagged a challenging business climate in the country. The U.K. has often accused China of conducting espionage in the country, and labeled it as a long-term strategic challenge. Financial Times reported on Tuesday that British officials were planning to tighten scrutiny of Chinese activity over national security concerns. The British government as recently as Dec"
"The market thinks BlackRock's Rick Rieder will be the next Fed chair. Here's what's at stake. A five-month process of finding the next Federal Reserve chair appears to be down to its final days, with one candidate emerging as the betting favorite even as others remain in the mix. BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder is seen by prediction markets as the frontrunner to replace Jerome Powell at the helm of the central bank. Kalshi has the Wall Street veteran holding a 48% chance, well ahead of the next-closest competitor, former Governor Kevin Warsh, at 31%. But sentiment has been volatile, and it was Warsh who held a decided advantage less than a week ago. What has swung the pendulum seems tenuous: In a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum, Trump called Rieder ""very impressive,"" and a Bloomberg News report, citing unnamed sources, said White House officials generally liked Rieder. While that was enough to sway wagers on sites like Kalshi and Polymarket, some on Wall Street are less convinced and still see it as a competitive race yet to be decided by a notoriously fick"
"U.S.-India trade deal at 'very advanced stage,' Indian petroleum minister tells CNBC. A much-anticipated trade deal between India and the U.S. is at ""a very advanced stage,"" India's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC Tuesday. ""I would try and look at the positive side, I'm not a soothsayer, I don't know when trade deals will get signed, how long it takes ... but I think one everybody needs to chill a bit,"" he told CNBC's Amitoj Singh, as India and the EU announced a landmark trade deal. ""I'm told by the people who are in it the negotiations that it's at a very advanced stage, and I'm hoping that, sooner rather than later, it will also see the light of day,"" he added of the U.S. deal. Describing the relationship between the U.S. as ""very strong,"" Singh Puri said India supported a multilateral trading system and this was evident in the free trade agreement deal with the European Union , announced earlier Tuesday. That open-to-trade stance would be of benefit to Washington as trade talks continued, he added. ""There's an economic opportu"
"China's industrial profits edge up in 2025, reversing three years of declines as Beijing curbs price wars. China's industrial profits rose 0.6% in 2025 from a year earlier, snapping three consecutive years of declines as officials moved to rein in aggressive price competition and companies sought overseas growth amid weak domestic demand. The pace of growth accelerated from 0.1% in the January-to-November period, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The recovery last year was driven by policy intervention, particularly Beijing's campaign against aggressive price undercutting, and companies' efforts to expand overseas, said Tianchen Xu, a senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Industrial profits climbed 5.3% in December from a year earlier, the strongest performance since September when earnings surged 21.6%. Profits had faltered in the prior two months, falling 5.5% in October and 13.1% in November. In December, China's factory activity returned to growth after eight straight months of contraction, in part thanks to pre-holiday stockpiling ahead of the Lu"
"AI spending wasn't the biggest engine of U.S. economic growth in 2025, despite popular assumptions. The popular narrative that artificial intelligence is the engine keeping the U.S. economy alive appears to be overstated, according to recent analyses. The AI boom has reshaped market valuations, driven large investments and record bond issuance to finance data centers, and heavily influenced gross domestic product, or GDP, especially in early 2025. This led many economists and market participants to suggest AI investment was the savior of an otherwise-stagnant domestic economy. However, a January report from MRB Partners U.S. economic strategist Prajakta Bhide reveals that consumption was the most crucial driver of U.S. GDP growth last year, which is usually the case in periods of economic expansion. AI-related capital expenditures were the second-biggest driver, she said. ""AI is an important part of the growth story, but it's not the only part of the growth story. That's a narrative that's out there, that if we didn't have the AI capex, GDP would have slumped last year. And that's s"

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV dropped 5.4% for its biggest one-day decline since last April during the tariff-triggered downturn. The fund is now down about 22% from its recent high, pushing the software industry into bear-market territory and underscoring how quickly sentiment has turned against one of Wall Street's former favorite industries. Month to date, IGV is down more than 13%, on pace for its worst month since October 2008 when the fund fell 23%.

"The Future Of Wall Street And Enterprise: Fintech 50 2026. By Hank Tucker , Forbes Staff. T he acceptance and integration of artificial intelligence has accelerated on Wall Street in the last year, and financial institutions have no shortage of options at their fingertips to make the most of it. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of America s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, acknowledged at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January that it will likely eliminate jobs. Don t put your head in the sand, he told attendees. While it s an anxiety-inducing prospect for many individual workers, there s little doubt that the businesses who use it the best will have higher margins and better growth prospects as a result of new technologies, and the savviest founders and employees will be able to multiply their productivity.

H istorically, only a small set of fintech investing apps have found ways to build big, sustainable businesses, as incumbents have leaned on their cost advantages and lowered their fees to compete with challengers. Robinhood has beaten the odds and disrupted investing more than anyone.

"Why Microsoft And Amazon Are Turning To Nuclear Power For AI. By Robert Rapier , Senior Contributor. For years, Silicon Valley took electricity for granted. The cloud sounded intangible, almost detached from the physical world. But now, artificial intelligence is ending that illusion. Behind every large language model and AI assistant sits a growing fleet of data centers that require enormous and continuous amounts of power. Industry analysts estimate that a single hyperscale AI data center can demand 300 to 500 megawatts of electricity, comparable to the consumption of a mid-sized city . Multiply that across dozens of facilities under construction, and energy supply becomes less of an operating expense and more of a strategic constraint. Microsoft and Amazon are responding with moves that signal a fundamental shift. Instead of relying solely on renewable energy contracts or traditional grid access, which alienates communities by driving up utility bills, both companies are securing direct relationships with nuclear power generation.

B usiness-to-business banking remains the biggest category on this year s Fintech 50, with 11 companies building software that helps businesses handle money without needing a traditional bank relationship for every task. Some issue cards. Others move payments, offer loans or track expenses. Many sit quietly in the background, connecting to real banks while giving business owners one place to manage cash flow. Fewer spreadsheets, faster payments and less time spent on back-office work is the appeal.

"This Is No Way To Fix The Government s Finances. By Steve Forbes , Forbes Staff. The Congressional Budget Office CBO has issued a new report on the horrible state of the U.S. government s finances. But the cures proffered by most experts raising taxes and cutting entitlement benefits are wrong. The national debt is indeed exploding. As a portion of our economy, it s exceeding the level it reached during WWII. That this is happening in peacetime shows how irresponsible the Washington politicians have become. The CBO has just released its 10-year budget forecast. The projections are awful. Revenues will go up nicely, but spending is out of control. The national debt will continue to climb ominously. The cuts the Trump Administration achieved in its Big Beautiful Bill last summer and the reduction in the number of federal employees that came from Elon Musk s Doge efforts pale in comparison to the awful negative trends.

"The Prognosis For Longitudinal Mental Health Relationships Between Humans And AI. By Lance Eliot , Contributor. In today s column, I examine the potential impacts of using AI for mental health guidance on a long-term basis. The deal is this. People on a massive scale are making use of generative AI and large language models LLMs as their ad hoc mental health advisor. This usage only principally began in 2022 when ChatGPT was first released. Currently, in 2025, millions of people are now using the major LLMs of ChatGPT, GPT-5, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and other models for garnering mental health insights. It is reasonable to assume that this usage is going to increase over the next several years. More people will opt to use AI. People who are already using AI will undoubtedly continue their use. The AI will get better at dispensing therapeutic advice. A cycle of prolonged use and expanding use for mental health purposes is nearly inevitable. An enormous number of people will be racking up a lot of time devoted to relying on LLMs as their casual AI-based therapist. Wha"
"Despite The Headlines, Paramount Skydance Bid For WBD Likely To Fail. By Rick Ellis , Contributor. When the Warner Bros. Discovery WBD board announced early Tuesday that it was reopening merger talks with Paramount Skydance PSKY , there were a lot of think pieces published by industry reporters which argued some combination of Netflix s bid is in trouble, and Paramount Skydance has a second chance to win Warner Bros. Discovery!"" The problem is that both of those takes are likely to be - as Wall Street experts have been known to say - a bunch of hooey. There are a few things to remember about the details of these negotiations and that will help you to frame things in the proper light. First of all, the negotiations between WBD and PKSY could not have reopened without Netflix s approval. When the WBD board initially decided that Netflix had the best offer, the two companies signed an exclusive agreement that prevented any other party from negotiating directly with Warner Bros. Discovery. Given that, it s unlikely that Netflix would have agreed to a"
"Cleveland Guardians Spring Training Begins With Position Competition. By Bernie Pleskoff , Contributor. The Cleveland Guardians have interesting position decisions to make, as spring training opens in Goodyear, Arizona. As goodyearbp.com indicated, Goodyear Ballpark was the result of a 108 million dollar construction project that was completed in 2009. The Guardians moved their spring training facility from Winter Haven, Florida, to the Phoenix suburb of Goodyear, Arizona, in 2009. The following year, the Cincinnati Reds joined the Guardians, sharing the ball park, but operating from their own completely different, stand alone training complex. There are 8,000 fixed seats, and 1.500 lawn berm area locations, plus suites and group areas at Goodyear Ballpark. A rather quaint facility, fans enjoy a tremendous view of the playing field from every location. Ohio-themed foods are featured in concession stands that ring the park. A 60 foot, 6 inch sculpture, called The Ziz sits outside the ballpark. The fiberglass sculpture was created by artist David Lipsk"
"One Risky Jump Could Propel Adeliia Petrosian To The Olympic Figure Skating Podium. By Caroline Price , Contributor. One jump could change the game for Russian figure skater, Individual Neutral Athlete AIN Adellia Petrosian. Petrosian goes for her first Olympic medal on Thursday in the women s free skate competition. The skater finished fifth in her Olympic debut , showing confidence in only her second international skate since 2022 due to Russia s invasion of Ukraine. The 18-year-old from Moscow currently ranks below a trio of Japanese stars and defending world champion Alyssa Liu of the United States. However, in Thursday s free skate, Petrosian could climb the standings with a signature skill. Petrosian is the only skater in the current Olympic field capable of the highly difficult quadruple toe loop jump. Throughout her national skating career in Russia, the skater has landed three quadruple jumps: a quadruple toe loop, a quadruple loop, and a quadruple flip. After months of struggling with nagging injuries, Petrosian has only trained the quadruple toe in Milan."
"Bruce Meyer Elected Interim Exec Director Of MLBPA After Tony Clark Resigns. By Maury Brown , Senior Contributor. The MLB Players Association has a new executive director. After Tony Clark unexpectedly resigned on Tuesday , the Executive Board of the MLBPA, comprising 72 players representing both Major League and Minor League Baseball, voted unanimously to elect Bruce Meyer as the interim executive director of the MLBPA. Meyer s term is two years. In doing so, he becomes the eighth executive director of the union for players in MLB and MiLB. MLBPA General Counsel Matt Nussbaum will now become Deputy Executive Director.

His selection is critical given bargaining sessions between the owners and players in MLB are slated to start shortly after the start of the upcoming season, now just weeks away. The current MLB labor deal expires at midnight on December 1. It is widely expected that a lockout will occur and that ML"
"Apollo Reassures Clients Over CEO s Epstein Files Appearances: Nothing New. By Martina Di Licosa , Forbes Staff. Investment firm Apollo issued a statement Wednesday saying that neither its CEO, Marc Rowan, nor the other current executives named in the recently released batch of Epstein files had any relationship with the disgraced financier, pointing to the results of an internal investigation in 2020. Emails from Epstein staffer Lesley Groff show that Rowan made plans to visit Epstein in person as late as 2015.

"Sidney Crosby's Absence: Is Canada Still The Olympic Gold Favorite?. By Carol Schram , Senior Contributor. Thanks to an overtime goal by Mitch Marner, Canada won its quarter-final match against Czechia on Wednesday at the 2026 Winter Olympics. But on the road to victory, the Canadians lost their leader. Early in the second period, with Canada trailing 2-1, team captain Sidney Crosby left the game after getting tangled up with punishing Czech defender Radko Gudas. Crosby s right leg appeared to buckle when he braced for contact on a big hit from Czechia defenseman Radko Gudas a few minutes into the second, reported Stephen Whyno of the Associated Press, from Milan. Laboring as he stayed on the ice, Crosby got crunched into the boards by Gudas and Martin Necas and then left after shaking his right leg and wincing. Rather than be deflated by losing their captain, the Canadian players redoubled their resolve not to see their tournament end at the quarter-final stage. Nathan MacKinnon and Nick Suzuki scored the goals to set the stage for overtime. With t"

"Michael Soroka Got An Incentive-Laden Contract From The Diamondbacks. By Dan Freedman , Contributor. Michael Soroka has had an interesting if not disappointing career. Drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the first round 28 th overall in 2015 out of Alberta, Canada, he made his major league debut in 2018. Over 2018 and 2019, Soroka made 34 starts in Atlanta, going 15-5 with a 2.79 ERA, 3.38 FIP, and a better than 3-to-1 strikeout to walk ratio. The future was bright, and the Braves thought they had an ace on their hands. Soroka s Covid-shortened 2020 season ended after three starts when he tore his Achilles tendon. He had surgery to repair the rupture, and was on the road to recovery when he re-tore the same tendon simply walking through the Braves clubhouse in June of the following year. That ended the 2021 season for him as well. In 2023, Soroka made his way back onto the mound, getting his first start on May 29 th at Oakland. He threw 83 pitches over six innings, ultimately taking the loss. But the Braves did win four of his next five outings, even tho"

"Dodgers Would Be First NL Team To Win 3 Straight World Series. By Dan Schlossberg , Senior Contributor. No team has won three straight World Series since the Yankees of 1998-99-2000.

"X s Algorithm Makes Users More Conservative, Study Suggests. By Martina Di Licosa , Forbes Staff.

The study assigned active U.S.-based users to either the algorithmic or chronological feed for seven weeks in 2023, measuring political attitudes and online behaviour.

"Wendy s Stock Surges After Billionaire Nelson Peltz Calls It Undervalued. By Mary Whitfill Roeloffs , Forbes Staff.

"My ex-wife took out a 100K Parent PLUS loan for our son. Am I morally or legally obliged to pay it off?. Listen 7 min In 2023, after 28 years of marriage, my wife and I divorced. In the divorce proceedings, she asked that I take responsibility for half of a loan that she cosigned for our son s education. I was aware of the loan, but not privy to the details and, certainly, not aware that it was a loan of 100,000 at 7%-plus interest. Previously, she had indicated to me that it was a much smaller amount so the actual terms came as a surprise. State law does not require me to assume such a debt, and it remained hers after the divorce. In the past year, I have discovered that it was a Parent PLUS loan, which means it is her debt alone. Minimum payments are 700 a month. She makes this payment and our son contributes 200 to her each month. Our son makes 45,000 a year and has no immediate prospects for significantly increasing his income in the near future."

Those required minimum distributions RMDs could raise your tax bill. There's another problematic consequence of RMDs too many people overlook.
